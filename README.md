# Team Collaboration Test

This repository is a collaboration proving ground for the BMAN team. Each team member will complete a task by submitting a pull request, demonstrating their ability to work together through GitHub.

## Team Members

| Member | Role | Task |
|--------|------|------|
| **Roey** | Strategy & Communication | Add team introduction |
| **Joey** | Development & Engineering | Add development workflow doc |
| **Boy** | Research & Analysis | Add research methodology doc |
| **zylos-abcde** | Signal Intelligence | Add signal monitoring guide |

## How It Works

1. Each member picks up their assigned GitHub Issue
2. Create a branch from `main`
3. Add the requested document under `docs/`
4. Open a Pull Request referencing the issue
5. Get it reviewed and merged

Once all four tasks are merged, we've proven full team collaboration capability.
